Part of VastSurge's server? Playing AMOGUS??? We've got our own version of the Town of Us mod by slushiegoose (updated by Donners).

Here's resources for getting everything installed:

PROXIMITY CHAT:
Download & install the latest release of Better-CrewLink-Setup.exe from https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/releases
This program will run alongside the game. No further setup needed!


Town of Us Mod:
You will need to do some setup for this.

1. Install Among Us through Steam, and run the game at least once.
2. In your Steam library, right click on Among Us -> Manage -> Browse Local Files.
3. Go to your "steamapps/common folder", which should be one folder up from where you currently are.
4. Duplicate the entire "Among Us" folder (copy & paste).
5. Rename this new folder "Among Us - ToU". It needs to be exact!
6. In this folder, the mod files are in "ToU.v3.0.1.zip". Open ToU.v3.0.1.zip -> ToU.v3.0.1.
7. Copy & paste the contents of "ToU.v3.0.1.zip/ToU.v3.0.1" into your new "Among Us - ToU" folder.
8. Run Among Us.exe from this folder. It may take a minute to load. Feel free to make a shortcut to this exe, as it will not show in your Steam library.

It worked if the game runs and you see "Town of Us" in the main menu!
